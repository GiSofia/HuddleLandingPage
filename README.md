## Overview

This challenge allows me to improve my html and css skills, so I thank the frontend mentor for putting real challenges, which makes us keep improving.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to accommodate the two sections in the mobile aspect.

```css
    .section-container{
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        padding: 45px 15px;
    }
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about CSS, get to know its properties very well, as well as practice more with the Grid and Flexbox themes. Also, continue to learn how media queries work.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This website helped me a lot with flexbox

## Acknowledgments

I did this challenge alone, without anyone's help, more than the resources I occupied.
